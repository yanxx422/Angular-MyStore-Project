# About The Project

MyStore is an Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.2.6.

## Project features
This application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
* Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
